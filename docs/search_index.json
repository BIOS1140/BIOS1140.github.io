[["w05.html", "Week 5 assignment", " Week 5 assignment 1. Vectorising functions To complete this part of the assignment, you need to define the calc_af() function from the tutorial: calc_af &lt;- function(counts){ # get the number of samples n &lt;- sum(counts) # calculate frequency of 1st allele - p p &lt;- ((counts[1]*2) + counts[2])/(2*n) return(p) } You have the following data frame containing genotype counts from four populations: counts &lt;- data.frame( A1A1 = c(10, 0, 84, 32), A1A2 = c(30, 48, 13, 15), A2A2 = c(75, 60, 3, 28), location = c(&quot;loc1&quot;, &quot;loc2&quot;, &quot;loc3&quot;, &quot;loc4&quot;) ) Use calc_af() together with apply() to calculate \\(p\\) for each population. Add the values to counts as a column. Use ifelse() to create a column that says above 0.5 if p in the population is larger than 0.5, and below 0.5 if its not. You should print the data frame in the end and show the output in the hand-in. 2. A worked example of \\(F_{ST}\\) We sample two fish populations - one in the lake and the other in a stream. We genotype them at locus B. In the lake, the genotype counts are - B1B1 = 32, B1B2 = 12 and B2B2 = 6. In the stream, the genotype counts are B1B1 =10, B1B2 = 16, B2B2 = 43. Calculate the average expected heterozygosity for the two populations. Optional: make a function to calculate average expected heterozygosity. Calculate the expected heterozygosity for the two populations as a metapopulation. Optional: make a function to calculate expected heterozygosity in the metapopulation. Calculate \\(F_{st}\\) between the lake and stream fish. How do you interpret this value? 3. More on \\(F_{ST}\\) To complete this part of the assignment, you need to define the calc_fst() function, in addition to the calc_af() function defined in question 1. calc_fst &lt;- function(p_1, p_2){ # calculate q1 and q2 q_1 &lt;- 1 - p_1 q_2 &lt;- 1 - p_2 # calculate total allele frequency p_t &lt;- (p_1 + p_2)/2 q_t &lt;- 1 - p_t # calculate expected heterozygosity # first calculate expected heterozygosity for the two populations # pop1 hs_1 &lt;- 2*p_1*q_1 # pop2 hs_2 &lt;- 2*p_2*q_2 # then take the mean of this hs &lt;- (hs_1 + hs_2)/2 # next calculate expected heterozygosity for the metapopulations ht &lt;- 2*p_t*q_t # calculate fst fst &lt;- (ht - hs)/ht # return output return(fst) } Using the calc_af() and calc_fst() functions we developed during the tutorial and the lct_freq data, calculate \\(F_{ST}\\) between the Han_China and the Swedish_and_Finnish_Scandinavia populations. What might explain the \\(F_{ST}\\) value you calculate? Using the functions we developed in the tutorial, calculate \\(F_{ST}\\) around the LCT gene between Americans of European descent and also between African Americans. Plot this like we plotted the \\(F_{ST}\\) between European Americans and East Asians. What is the highest value of \\(F_{ST}\\)? How does this compare with the highest \\(F_{ST}\\) between European Americans and East Asians that we investigated in the tutorial? "]]

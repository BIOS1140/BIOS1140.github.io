# Week 9 assignment {- #w09}

Since the full data set is very large, we cannot perform PCA on this in R. However, we have conducted this for you and you can find the full PCA data set [here](https://bios1140.github.io/data/full_village_dogs_pca.tsv). You can also find the eigenvectors [here](https://bios1140.github.io/data/full_village.eigenval). More on this in the assignment!

## 1 -- for-loops

a. Create one vector containing names of 4 animals you feel strongly about. Create another vector that contains what you feel about the animal. Use a for-loop to print the animal and the feeling together (like in section 1.3 of the tutorial). Example output:

```{}
"Pangolins are amazing"
# and similarly for 3 more animals
```



b. A bacterial population grows with 10% every day. The first day, we have 10 bacteria per $mm^2$. Use a for loop to calculate the number of bacteria each day for 100 days, and plot the result. How many bacteria do we have per $mm^2$ on the last day?


## 2 -- Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium

You genotype a species of grasshoppers along a north south transect across the European Alps. Near Munich, Germany, north of the Alps you sample 120 individuals; near Innsbruck, Austria, within the Alps you sample 122 individuals; near Verona, Italy, south of the Alps you sample 118 individuals. you find the following number of each genotype:

* Munich: 6 (a1a1), 33 (a1a2), 81 (a2a2)
* Innsbruck: 20 (a1a1), 59 (a1a2), 43 (a2a2)
* Verona: 65 (a1a1), 39 (a1a2), 14 (a2a2)

a. Using the r code we learnt during the tutorial, calculate the allele frequencies in each population. Then test (statistically) whether there is a deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in each of them. If any of the populations deviate, what could be the cause of the deviation?

b. In the statistical test in the previous question we use the Hardy Weinberg model as a _null model_. Explain what this means.

## 3 -- Genetic drift

a. Using the for-loop from the tutorial as a starting point, simulate drift over 2000 generations for a population of 100 individuals. Make 3 simulations,and use initial $p$s of 0.3, 0.5 and 0.9 respectively. Plot your results.

b. How does altering p from 0.3, 0.5 and 0.9 alter the outcome of the simulations? Which is more likely to go to fixation?
